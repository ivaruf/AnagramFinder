# AnagramFinder

AnagramFinder is a simple java application that will find the anagrams in a list of words, and print them to shell.

The application requires gradle. Instructions to install gradle can be found [here](http://www.gradle.org/installation).

If you are on linux this will do the trick:

```
sudo apt-get install gradle
```

Run the application with:

```
gradle run
```

This will run the program using the bundled list of words found in "src/main/resources/eventyr.txt"
